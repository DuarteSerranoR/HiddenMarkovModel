# General purpose Hidden Markov Model

This is a hmm that can be configured to be used in any scenario.
<br/>
Some changes to the code need to be done to be used, mainly when it comes to the data preparation, depending on the data type/format.
<br/>
<br/>
Run main.py to train and check what is still needed to program into the model for it to be usable.
<br/>

## Examples on how to use the Model:

 - [ Parts Of Speech Tagging ](https://github.com/DuarteSerranoR/HiddenMarkovModel/tree/parts_of_speech_tagging_dev)
 - [ Subtitle Splitting ](https://github.com/DuarteSerranoR/HiddenMarkovModel/tree/parts_of_speech_splitting_dev) (Not Implemented)
