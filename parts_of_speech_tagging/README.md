# General purpose Hidden Markov Model

This is a hmm that can be configured to be used in any scenario.
Some changes to the code need to be done to be used, mainly when it comes to the data preparation, depending on the data type/format.

Run main.py to train and check what is still needed to program into the model for it to be usable.
